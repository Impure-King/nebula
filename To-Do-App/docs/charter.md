# To-Do-App Project Charter

## Project Overview
A web-accessible To-Do application that allows users to manage their tasks through basic CRUD operations and time-based task viewing capabilities. The application will initially be developed as a local web setup using Flask framework.

## Project Objectives
1. Create a functional To-Do list application with web accessibility
2. Implement secure user-specific task management
3. Provide intuitive task organization and viewing features
4. Establish a robust testing framework

## Core Features
### Task Management
- Add new tasks
- Update existing tasks
- Delete tasks
- View upcoming tasks (next)
- View today's tasks
- View tomorrow's tasks

### Technical Requirements
- Flask web framework implementation
- Database integration with user authentication
- Local web server setup
- Unit testing coverage

## Team Roles and Responsibilities
1. Development Team
   - Individual developers assigned to specific functions
   - Code implementation following best practices
   - Branch management for feature development

2. Testing Team
   - Create and implement test cases
   - Ensure code quality and functionality
   - Collaborate with developers for bug fixes

3. Code Review Team
   - Review merge requests
   - Ensure code quality standards
   - Approve or reject changes based on requirements

## Development Process
1. Feature Branch Creation
   - Create issues for each feature
   - Implement features in separate branches
   - Follow branching naming conventions

2. Testing Protocol
   - Unit tests for each function
   - Integration testing
   - User acceptance testing

3. Code Review and Merge Process
   - Peer review requirements
   - Merge request approval process
   - Final review by project supervisor

## Timeline
- Sprint 1: Basic CRUD Operations
- Sprint 2: Time-based Task Views

## Success Criteria
1. All core features implemented and functioning
2. Comprehensive test coverage
3. Clean, maintainable code structure
4. Successful local web deployment
5. User-specific task management working correctly

## Risk Management
- Technical risks: Framework compatibility issues
- Timeline risks: Feature completion delays
- Quality risks: Testing coverage gaps

## Future Considerations
- Potential expansion to full web deployment
- Enhanced security features
- Additional task management features
- User interface improvements
